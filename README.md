# MissingSemesterOfCS

## Brief Introduction
The "Missing Semester Of CS" course wants to tech us "computing ecosystem literacy" that is how to master tools like the command-line, text-editor, version control system and so on.

Mastering these tools not only enables you to spend less time on figuring out how to bend your tools to your will, but it also lets you solve problems that would previously seem impossibly complex.
